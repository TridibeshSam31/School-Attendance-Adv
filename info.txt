Models se start kiya

teacher model mai sbse pehle teacher ka name aana chaiye fir woh class ki teacher hai aur konse section ki teacher hai \
uske baad woh konse subject ki teacher hai woh bhi aana chaiye konki humme subject wise attendance bhi chahiye 


student model mai jyada kuch nhi chaiye student ki din mai sirf ek bar hi attendance honi chaiye yeh toh controller mai logic add krne ke liye add hoga
basically models mai humme student ka name chaiye and class chaiye woh konse section mai hai woh chaiye 

aur hume ek holiday ka bhi model chaiye because holiday ko count nhi krna humme so woh necessary hai

attendance model bhi bna diya jisme student teacher status date wagera sab aayegi
